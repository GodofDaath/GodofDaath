- 👋 Hi, I’m @GodofDaath (Raja Vamshi S V L N)
- 👀 I’m interested in working on Machine Learning and Cyberseurity Projects. I love to use data and perform various analysis to gather vital information. Also, I tend to use various ML frameworks for prediction tasks. I mainly use Python for these tasks. I am also well versed in C,C++ and Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unsupervised ML frameworks. I would then start on Deep Learning (have slight knowledge in that domain).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Cybersecurity projects.
